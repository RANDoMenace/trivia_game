# Trivia Game

##User stories

* As a user I would like a siimple game, i will use common sense as the subject.

	* (example)
righty tiety, lefty ______? a)mighty b)bitey c)loosey

* As a user I would like a visable scoring system, i will create a visable score board.

* As a user I want to know who is the winner, i will make an alert once the game is won.

##Progress

* HTML and CSS are all centered for easy viewing while coding.

* Working on logic of game. Decided to go with array for questions and answer key.

* I chose simple questions to go with a simple answer key.

* I then chose to make a continue button to move the game along, once a answer is selected.

* I went with replacing the text in the 'h2' tag.

* I decided to start the page off with the first question, and all variables start at 0.

* Then I connected a counter to the continue button which cycles through the questions array.

* Moved onto making the buttons work in the console. Then created an empty array to store the answers.

* Used the text inside the button to store as the answer inside the empty array.

* Got the answer sheet to score right answers, and pass on wrong answers.

* Used pop.() to capture last button pressed in case of player changing their mind about a question.

* Counter runs the score comparison, the info inside the arrays being compared, and the questions being displayed.

* Used an if/else statement to check questions end. Used a confirm alert to check if player wants to play again.

* If confirm is true then everything is reset to -1 to allow the first click of continue to register all variables to 0.

* Asked a UX student to help with directing user to click continue to move forward.

#Current

* Working on winner being displayed inside confirm box.
* Styling and user design.
* Maybe use fade in and outs for question display.
* Could randomize the questions.
* Could disable continue button until both player have choosen an answer.
